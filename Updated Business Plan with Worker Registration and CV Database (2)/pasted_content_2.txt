### **🎯 Comprehensive Project Prompt: HomeLink Addis Workforce Supply Platform**

**Project Name:** HomeLink Addis - Domestic & International Workforce Supply Portal

**Core Business Model:** We are a **workforce supply company** operating in Addis Ababa. We recruit, register, house, and manage a pool of domestic workers. We supply these vetted workers to two primary customer groups:
1.  **Addis Family Employers:** Directly for domestic work in their homes.
2.  **Local & Foreign Employment Agencies:** As a reliable source of pre-vetted candidates for the international market.

**Guarantee:** For our **Family Employer** clients, we offer a **1-Month Free Replacement Guarantee** if the provided worker is unsatisfactory and terminated within the first 30 days of placement.

### **🔀 7. Core System Data Flow & Integration**

1.  **Worker Registers & Pays:** Worker data is captured, subscription fee is paid → Profile status becomes *"Pending Review."*
2.  **HomeLink Staff Verifies:** Staff vet the profile and documents → Manually change status to *"Approved & Available."* The worker now appears in search results.
3.  **Client Searches:** Family Employers and Agencies search the pool of *"Approved & Available"* workers.
4.  **Hiring Trigger:**
    *   **If a Family Employer hires:** Worker status changes to *"Hired (Domestic)."* The 1-month replacement countdown begins.
    *   **If an Agency shortlists:** Worker status remains *"Available"* but can be marked as *"Under Review by Agency"* to indicate interest.
5.  **Replacement Logic:** If a replacement is triggered within 30 days, the original worker's status is reset (e.g., to *"Available"* or *"Needs Review"*), and a new worker is assigned from the pool.
